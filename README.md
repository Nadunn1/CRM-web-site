A Customer Management System (CMS) using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap involves creating a web application to manage customer information and interactions. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

HTML: Provides the structure of the web pages where users interact with the system. Forms are created for inputting and displaying customer data.

PHP: Handles the server-side logic. It processes form submissions, interacts with the database, and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer data.

JavaScript: Enhances user interaction by providing dynamic elements on the client side. For example, it can validate form inputs before submission or provide real-time updates without refreshing the page.

Bootstrap: A front-end framework used to design a responsive and visually appealing user interface. It offers pre-designed components like buttons, forms, and tables that are easy to integrate and customize.
